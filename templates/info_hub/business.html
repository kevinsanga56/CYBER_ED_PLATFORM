    <h1>💼 Digital Defense for Small Businesses</h1>
    <p>Small businesses are major targets for cybercriminals. Protecting your finances and client data is non-negotiable for staying operational.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>1. The Essential Defense: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</h2>
    <p>A stolen password is the starting point for most business hacks. MFA (Two-Factor Authentication) requires a second code from your phone, making the stolen password useless.</p>
    <p class="activity-box">
        <strong>Action Item:</strong> Enable MFA TODAY on your business email (Gmail, Outlook) and your mobile banking portal. It takes 5 minutes and stops 99.9% of phishing attacks.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Invoice and Payment Fraud (BEC)</h2>
    <p>Criminals take over a supplier's email (or spoof it) and send you a new invoice with *their* bank account details.</p>
    <p class="warning-text">
        **Stop! Verify! Call!** If you receive an email notifying you of a change in bank details for a payment, **DO NOT** reply to the email. Call your supplier using a phone number you know is correct (from an old invoice or their website).
    </p>

    <h2>3. The 3-2-1 Backup Rule (Ransomware Protection)</h2>
    <p>Ransomware locks up your files (invoices, client lists) until you pay a fee. A solid backup makes you immune.</p>
    <p><strong>The Rule:</strong> Keep at least **3** copies of your data, stored on **2** different types of media, with **1** copy stored **OFFLINE** (a disconnected hard drive or secure cloud storage).</p>
