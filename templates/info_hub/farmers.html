    <h1>🚜 Secure Technology for Tea Farmers</h1>
    <p>Your mobile phone is your banking tool, payment ledger, and business hub. Protecting it means protecting your harvest earnings.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>1. Mobile Banking and M-Pesa Safety</h2>
    <p>Scammers often call, pretending to be M-Pesa support or the Co-Op/Factory, trying to trick you into revealing your PIN or forwarding a confirmation message.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>**PIN Protection:** Your Mobile PIN is a secret. Never share it with *anyone*, even if they claim to be support staff.</li>
        <li>**Forwarding Scams:** If you receive a text asking you to "forward this message to confirm a transaction," it's a scam trying to authorize a payment from your phone.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>2. The Urgent Co-Op/Factory Scam</h2>
    <p>Be skeptical of unexpected calls or texts about issues with your payment or yield data.</p>
    <p class="activity-box">
        <strong>Action Item:</strong> If a call or text demands immediate action regarding your tea payment, **hang up**. Call the official, verified office number yourself to confirm the information. Do not trust the phone number or link provided in the suspicious message.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Protecting Your Smart Devices (IoT)</h2>
    <p>If you use smart scales, weather sensors, or other internet-connected farm equipment, they can be a weakness.</p>
    <p class="warning-text">
        **Default Passwords:** Change the default passwords on *all* smart farm equipment and your Wi-Fi router immediately. Use the **Password Checker** tool for strong, unique passwords.
