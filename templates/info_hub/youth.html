    <h1>🧑‍💻 Cyber Safety for Youth: Protect Your Future Identity</h1>
    <p>Being online is fun, but every post creates a **digital footprint** that follows you forever. Learn how to stay safe from scams, protect your privacy, and manage your reputation.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>1. The Digital Footprint Challenge 👣</h2>
    <p>Think before you post! Your personal information (where you live, where you go to school, or embarrassing content) can be seen by future employers or scammers.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>**Key Rule:** If you wouldn't say it in front of a teacher or a future boss, don't post it.</li>
        <li>**Over-Sharing:** Never post photos of your school ID, plane tickets, or documents with your full name and birthday.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Privacy Settings Scavenger Hunt 🔒</h2>
    <p>Control who sees what! Most social media platforms default to "Public." Change them now!</p>
    <p class="activity-box">
        <strong>Activity:</strong> Go to your settings on Instagram/TikTok and find these controls:
        <ol>
            <li>Change your account to **Private** (only approved followers can see posts).</li>
            <li>Turn off **Location Services** for social media apps.</li>
            <li>Use a **strong, unique password** for every gaming/social account (and use the **Password Checker** tool!).</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    
    <h2>3. Spotting Gaming & V-Bucks Scams</h2>
    <p>If an offer for free game currency, skins, or accounts seems too good to be true, it's a trap. These scams try to steal your login credentials.</p>
    <p class="warning-text">
        **Red Flag:** Never give your password to someone claiming to be a "moderator" or "security expert" over DMs. Real support staff do not ask for passwords.
